## üìù **Initial Setup & Error Resolution**

### Prompt 1: Kaminari Pagination Error Fix

```
ActionView::MissingTemplate in Leaderboards#index Showing /Users/visnextdev/Documents/projects/leaderboard_app/app/views/leaderboards/index.html.erb where line #114 raised: Missing partial kaminari/tailwind/_paginator with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html, :html], :variants=>[], :handlers=>[:raw, :erb, :html, :builder, :ruby, :jbuilder]}. Searched in: * "/Users/visnextdev/Documents/projects/leaderboard_app/app/views" * "/Users/visnextdev/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.3.5/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/kaminari-core-1.2.2/app/views"
```

**Cursor AI Response**: Created all necessary Kaminari pagination partials in `app/views/kaminari/tailwind/` directory including `_paginator.html.erb`, `_page.html.erb`, `_prev_page.html.erb`, `_next_page.html.erb`, `_first_page.html.erb`, `_last_page.html.erb`, and `_gap.html.erb`.

### Prompt 2: SQLite Database Error Fix

```
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid in Leaderboards#index Showing /Users/visnextdev/Documents/projects/leaderboard_app/app/views/leaderboards/index.html.erb where line #55 raised: SQLite3::SQLException: near "ILIKE": syntax error: SELECT "leaderboards".* FROM "leaderboards" WHERE (name ILIKE '%crypto%') ORDER BY "leaderboards"."rank" ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

**Cursor AI Response**: Modified the `search_by_name` scope in `app/models/leaderboard.rb` to use `LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER(?)` instead of `ILIKE` for SQLite compatibility.
